  <h2>My Top 3 Animes</h2> 
  <ul> 
   <li><h3>Attack on Titan</h3> <p>Attack on titan(AOT) starts like a hype action show about humans fighting giants, but it quickly turns into this insanely gripping story about war, freedom, and what people become when they’re pushed to the edge — and that shift is what makes it addictive. The plot keeps flipping your expectations, the characters actually grow and change in realistic (sometimes uncomfortable) ways, and every season feels bigger, darker, and smarter than the last. You don’t just watch it for the fights, you watch because you need to know what happens next — and by the end, you’re left thinking about it, not just moving on to the next show. </p> </li> 
   <li><h3>Death Note</h3> <p>Death note hooks you immediately with the idea of an ordinary student getting the power to kill anyone just by writing their name, and then turns that into a nonstop psychological chess match between two geniuses trying to outthink and outplay each other. It’s tense, smart, and addictive because every episode feels like a mental duel, where one wrong move means total defeat, and the line between justice and evil gets blurrier the longer it goes on. You’re not just watching to see who wins — you’re watching to see how far a human being can fall when they believe they’re right. </p> </li> 
   <li><h3>Demon Slayer</h3> <p>Demon Slayer hooks you with its gorgeous animation and fast, clean action, but what keeps you watching is how personal and emotional the story is — it’s about a boy fighting not for power or glory, but simply to save his sister and protect others from the same loss he suffered. Every battle feels meaningful because the enemies aren’t just monsters, they’re broken people with tragic pasts, and that gives the whole show a bittersweet, human core. It’s easy to get into, constantly engaging, and emotionally sincere in a way that makes it quietly addictive</p> </li> 
  </ul>
